# data_visualization
data visulaization project using tableau with more than 14 sheet and one dashboard 


about the data :
The data comes from EPAâ€™s Air Quality System (AQS). All the collected reports are aggregated and summarized by the EPA system. All the data were compressed into a single Comma-Separated Value.
the data includes the pollution standards and the air quality standards. 
the numbers in the dataset we have were calculated are An 8-hour average that is calculated for every clock hour
The dataset Included 52 States, 517 counties, and 674 cities in the USA.
The data were calculated from 2020 to 2021.

main questions : 
Q1 | WHICH STATE HAD THE HIGHEST ' 1ST MAX VAULE' ?
Q2 | ANALYZE THE AVERAGE AQI BASED ON STATE NAME
Q3 | ANALYZE THE OBSERVATION COUNT AND ARTHEMETIC MEAN BY STATE NAME
Q4 | ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF EVENT TYPE ON AQI?

We can see that Arizona has the darkest shade which means the highest (AQI). and the higher the number the more polluted the air quality can be. 
but it became harder to differentiate the other states due to the color similarity.
the AQI can be seen to associated with the area of the state too.

This scatter plot here is visualizing how the arithmetic mean is correlated with number of observations.
We can see that most of the records are strong positively correlated. 
the arithmetic mean is the aggregation of results of the standards.

In  the geospatial map. We can see the distribution of the observations over the 52 states. 
The percentage of observations count are shown as text and average arithmetic is visualized as color brightness. The darker the shade is the higher the arithmetic mean. 
even though Arizona had less number of observations but still got a high arithmetic mean

These visualizations show us the effect of the occurrence of an event on the AQI ratio, we clearly note the impact of the occurrence of events on air pollution
The representation was done in three different ways to convey the meaning
bubbles
Pie
Fixed bars
In this case, we choose bubbles because it communicates meaning and feeling more, especially its association with air, which will make it the most appropriate choice

This visualization was used to display the aql difference in the locations where the events occurred during the month (June and August).
